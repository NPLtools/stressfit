    "This script implements common workflow for the data treatment with StressFit. On the input, STRESFIT uses a list of neutron scattering events with associated data (position, wave vectors, weight factor and \"as-measured\" lattice spacing - $d_{hkl}$}) accessible at given instrument setup. This list describes the instrumental sampling distribution independently on the sample. It can be obtained by ray-tracing simulation of the instrument using appropriate software, such as McStas (<a href='http://mcstas.org'>http://mcstas.org</a>) or SIMRES (<a href='https://github.com/saroun/simres'>https://github.com/saroun/simres</a>). \n",

    "\n",
    "- “centre of gravity” and size of the neutron sampling volume as a function of sample position (in 3D),\n",
    "- variation of intensity and position of diffraction peaks due to the perturbation of sampling distribution (material boundaries, absorption, composition and texture gradients),\n",
    "- “as measured” (smeared) intensity and strain distributions including the pseudo-strain effects,\n",
    "- least-squares fit of intrinsic strain and intensity distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "</p><p>\n",
    "STRESSFIT enables to model pseudo-strains for several sample shapes such as curved plates, cylinders, spheres, tubes (both single- and multi-channel) and polygonal rods. Neutron attenuation tables for several common materials generated with the help of the NCrystal library (<a href='https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal'>https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal</a>) are provided as a part of the package resources. Currently, STRESSFIT allows for least squares fitting of measured scans for a single strain component. Simultaneous fitting of multiple strain or stress tensor components is envisaged in future versions.\n",
