    "This script permits to treat pseudo strains in neutron residual strain measurements. Pseudo strains due to partial immersion of sampling volume in the sample, steep intrinsic strain gradients and heterogeneous distribution of scattering probability can be treated. The script employs Monte Carlo convolution method, which uses sampling points produced by Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation of the diffractometer to model smearing of intrinsic sample properties by instrumental response. Each point has all available information about a scattering event: position, initial and final neutron wave vector, probability and dhkl value associated with this sampling point. Such a sampling distribution can be simulated rather quickly for any instrument setup, for example by the ray-tracing program SIMRES (http://neutron.ujf.cas.cz/restrax). The sampling distribution is then reused to cary out the convolution with any sample shape, position, orientation and strain distribution. This decoupling of MC ray-tracing simulation from the convolution procedure permits to write a code which is rather fast (typically about 1s per one scan at 1 CPU). It is therefore possible to use the MC integration as a part of cost function for least squares fitting.\n",

    "Development of a Python library STRESSFIT aims at providing tools for analysis of residual stress measurements, where pseudo strains can't be avoided and must be taken into account in data processing. Currently, STRESSFIT enables to model pseudo strains for several basic sample shapes (curved plates, full and hollow cylinders and spheres). It also enables least squares fitting of measured scans for a single strain component. Simultaneous fitting of multiple components with a single stress distribution model is envisaged in future versions. \n",

    "## Fit intensities\n",
    "Fitting of intensities allows to determine the variation of scattering probability and extinction with scan depth. It can also help to correct for any missfit between the encoder positions (stored in the data file) and true surface position. Note that sometimes these effects can't be distinguished from each other. With a strong variation of scattering probability (e.g. due to a greadient in texture or composition near the surface), it is not possible to reliably determine the surface position and extinction just from the intensity variation. Then some of the parameters must be determined independently and fixed for fitting. On the other hand, it is the product of extinction and scattering probability distributions which affects pseudo-strains, therefore they do not need to be exactly distinguished.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:<br/>\n",
    "Scattering probability and strain distributions are defined on the depth scale. Definition of the <i>depth</i> depends on the sample shape. For plates, it is the distance to the upper surface (in local coordinates of the sample). For sphers and cylinders, it is the distance from the curved surface (the outer one in the case of hollow shapes). For complex samples like ETubes, the 'depth' is a position inside the sample projected on the scan direction.\n",
