=========================
- Shapes updated: polygonal rod, load/save functions

- Message and progress loggers added
- Simplified script templates: use stressfit.create_script()
  and stressfit.create_notebook() to export them from resources.
- Extended library of attenuation tables (generated with the 
  help of NCrystal, https://github.com/mctools/ncrystal)
- Improved workspace management

release 1.1.0, 2022-02-07
=========================
- Extended library of sample shapes.
- Simplified top level API for writing scripts 
  (see stressfit_example1.py and *.ipynb), implemented in 
  the module commands.
- Workspace management (see the example script) permits to 
  manage workspace directories per user and per project.
- Extended resources for running tests and demo scripts.
- GUI implemented in Jupyter notebook (see stressfit.ipynb). 
  Experimental version - provides less flexibility than 
  writing own scripts, but it is intuitive and easy to use.
